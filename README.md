## Description

This project was built to allow me to showcase Module 10's topics of Object Oriented Programming and Test Driven Development. I was tasked with building a node.js based application that uses Inquirer to ask the user questions for inputs and then have those inputs be used to build a Team Profile site of their team's structure.

I also used Jest as a method to complete testing and use the TDD process of building code through a testing method.
